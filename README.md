# 🔥 UI5-Roles 🔥
A simple app showcasing how firebase and roles can be used to enable user role management.
Also this app can be used as a template on how a Open UI5/SAP UI5 app can be structured & implemented with firebase.
The app also showcases how the component approach can be used in combination with abstract managers to ensure high reusability of abstract logic & code. This includes the network, authentication & businesslogic layer. They are seperated out from the main controller code. Similar to what Spring MVC does.
